## Description
🔍 Creating node.js app interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. 

## Badges
🏆 N/A


## License

## Installation
💾 npm inquirer, mySQL must run before the program can be executed. 


## Usage
💻 
Understanding the relationship between Java Script and mySQL Code was a challenge.
Running the application in the command line was actually a positive experience for trouble shooting the code in case of errors. 
What is confusing about this assignment is the amount of code that was written. I realize that it is possible to refac the code to make it comfortably “dry”; however, my goal was to experiment with the code to understand it better. 
During our class, we discussed lesson 14-TwoTables, which includes a switch statement. I come to realize that this would have been a good or even better option for this assignment. Again, I am satisfied with the code that I applied, especially under consideration that I have not had support for this assignment. I am pleased!


## Contributing
👪 Please provide any feedback you may have. Note that I included code references, which provide some alternative methods to work with the code on hand. Thank you! 


## Tests
✏️ I included a inquirer.prompt statement within inquirer.prompt statement, to query for the deletion of either an employee or a role. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the deletion of the role working. Any support with this is greatly appreciated. See prompt 'Delete employee or role?'.
